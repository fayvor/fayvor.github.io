Statistical model.
Creating a statistical model for a linear system
Let's say we have some input variables and we believe the output variable is some linear combination of the inputs.  Or we can create terms from the inputs for which the output is a linear combination.  We could use x1, x2, ...

We are trying to solve the system of equations y = Ax + b + e.  The vector e is drawn from a distribution; the values of e are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.).  A common estimate for y is that where we minimize the sum of squares of e.
